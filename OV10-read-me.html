<H3>Overview</H3>
This is an attempt at using a single archive to distribute all the
files needed to model an aircraft in FlightGear. This archive should be
extracted into directory $FGROOT/Aircraft/OV10.  Some files will then need to be moved
to other directories.  I've attempted to keep as many of the files in 
directory $FGROOT/Aircraft/OV10 as possible.  Ideally I'd like to keep <i>all</i>
the files in one directory, but currently FlightGear requires some of them
to be placed elsewhere. The contents of the archive, and the directory in 
which each file or directory should reside, is listed below.

<H3>Bugs</H3>
I'm still fairly new to FlightGear, so some of these "bugs" may actually
be features :)

 <TD>3D model has some bugs</TD>
 <TD>The model is a from the Captain Slug OV-10A.
  The side of the cockpit flickers.  The model
  position has not been adjusted for FlightGear, so its wheels don't
  contact the ground properly.  The gear and control surfaces don't move. 
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
 <TD>There is something wrong with the instrument panel</TD> 
 <TD>It's using the T-38 panel.  See the T-38 read-me.</TD>

<H3>Flying the OV-10</H3>
Takeoff, no flaps, apply full throttle. Sound doesn't change as engine is already at about 100%.  Rotate
at 100 knots and climb at 130 knots.  To land fly downwind at 150 knots clean, on base slow to
120 knots, extending gear and half flaps passing through 130 knots. On final
extend full flaps and slow to 75 knots (for STOL landing) or 100 knots (if you want a long life).<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
Let me know if you'd like more features, and if you have recent time in the OV-10
let me know if this model flies reasonably close to the real airplane.
<BR><BR>

<H3>Notes</H3>
The engine model uses the FGSimTurbine module of JSBSim. The thrust value in the engine
configuration file is an estimated thrust for the engine/prop combination. Someday I'll add 
condition-lever inputs to the engine code.<BR><BR>
